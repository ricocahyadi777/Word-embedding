# Word embedding
Word embedding SVD vs Word2Vec
A NLP project that compare 2 methods to see similarities between words.
From the results we can see that Word2Vec is superior

The result is disappointing although the first graph does show that 'movie' and 'film' are actually very close

## Word2Vec
We use the state-of-art model in NLP

The result we expect to get. However we can see that there is a lot of sentiment such as 'like' and 'good'.
Thus we need to be mindful when comparing words in NLP, although they have a very high similarities they could mean different context.
